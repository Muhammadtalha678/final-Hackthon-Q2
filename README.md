# E-Commerce Furniture Project

This e-commerce project was originally designed in Figma during a hackathon and has now been fully developed into a functional furniture marketplace. The goal was to create a responsive, feature-rich platform within a week using Next.js and Sanity CMS. The project includes essential features such as product listings, a shopping cart, a checkout system, and an admin panel for managing operations.
